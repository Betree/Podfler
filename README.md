# Podfler

This project is currently paused and is not functional as-is. You may find some intresting schemas for the Arduino part as well as a simple interface for the Android app. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in this project.

**Podfler** is an open source connected flower pot. The plant watcher is based on an Arduino and monitors the air temperature and humidity, the luminosity and the ground humidity.

All these data are accessible via Wifi in the Android application.
